# Schvaan
A dynamic quadruped composed mostly of 3d printed parts and standard off-the-shelf hardware.
This repo is still under construction. Please refer to my design portfolio for an overview of my work in the meanwhile

Here's a quick preview of the robot:
  - 12 DOFs, each driven by a custom proprioceptive actuator.
  - Unique belt transmission designed to reduce tooth load, allowing use of lightweight 3d-printed pulleys
  - Capable of executing a leg homing routine, standing up and walking with a trot gait.
